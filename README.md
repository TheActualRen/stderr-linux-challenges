# Stderr Linux Challenges

## What do the Challenges Consist Of ?

These are a set of challenges created by stderr. The challenges range in difficulty and aim to test newcomers / veterans of Linux at their ability to use Linux utilities. 

Some of the programs are completely do-able with the utilities provided by Linux - other challenges may require some programming.

I strongly advice that you tackle the problems without the use of AI, but if you chose to use it, please use it sparingly. I have personally improved my ability and understanding of these technologies by tackling the problems the "hard way". 

## Prerequisites

To be able to tackle these problems, a **UNIX terminal environment** will be necessary.

It would be advisable to be somewhat **familiar with the terminal**.

Knowledge on some of the following Linux utilities may or may not be useful: 
- gunzip
- tar
- base64
- base32
- echo
- cat
- file -
